    "## Q1: Define the z-statistic and explain its relationship to the standard normal distribution. How is the z-statistic used in hypothesis testing?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: \n",
    "The z-statistic, or z-score, is a measure that indicates how many standard deviations an element is from the mean of a distribution. In hypothesis testing, the z-score is used to determine the probability of observing a sample statistic, assuming the null hypothesis is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "The z-score is calculated as:\n",
    "\\[ z = \\frac{(X - \\mu)}{\\sigma} \\]\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- \\( X \\) is the sample mean,\n",
    "- \\( \\mu \\) is the population mean, and\n",
    "- \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In hypothesis testing, the z-statistic helps to assess if the sample mean significantly deviates from the population mean. If the z-score falls beyond a critical threshold (e.g., Â±1.96 for a 95% confidence level), the null hypothesis may be rejected.\n"

    "**Answer**: \n",
    "The p-value is the probability of obtaining an observed sample result, or one more extreme, under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. It quantifies the evidence against the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A small p-value (e.g., 0.01) indicates that the observed result is unlikely under the null hypothesis and suggests that we may reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "- Generally, if the p-value is below a predetermined significance level (\\(\\alpha\\)), such as 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. If the p-value is high, we fail to reject it.\n"
